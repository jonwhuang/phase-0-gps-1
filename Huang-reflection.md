**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

The main thing I was confused about was how to check if the changes of a pull request were working properly before merging into the master. I didn't know how to check the inline image markdowns unless I merged it into the master and looked at the result.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

Using *fetch* and *merge* instead of *pull* was clarified during the GPS, as well as my question about checking on the changes of a pull request. I definitely also feel more confident about inline images and links.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I asked them about the pull request confusion, but mostly the rest was for clarification of the GPS instructions. I think we definitely got a good understanding of how GitHub allows for collaboration on projects!

**What still confuses you about git?**

Right now, I don't have any specific questions, but I'm sure that once we start collaborating on projects more, some things will start to come up that will confuse us.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

I had a good time with my pair and guide! We tackled the challenges successfully and I was able to get a good feel of switching between driver and navigator too.

**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I already generally understood the Git concepts and did not struggle with anything. I was confused about the difference between the commands *pull* and *fetch*. 

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

The difference between *pull* and *fetch*. I finally understand that *pull* is just the combination of *fetch* and *merge*.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

The session went really well and we did not have alot of questions to ask.
I just needed some clarification with the release notes and also the commands above.

**What still confuses you about git?**

At this point nothing yet! I have the basic concepts and workflow understood.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

It was great! My pair and also our guide was awesome! We tackled the challenge like pros!
